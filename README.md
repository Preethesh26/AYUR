# 🌿 FloraAI  
### Real-Time Medicinal Plant Identification Using AI and Mobile Vision

FloraAI is an AI-powered Android mobile application that enables real-time identification of medicinal plants using deep learning–based image classification. The system integrates computer vision, NLP, and cloud technologies to provide accurate plant identification along with reliable medicinal and health-related information.

## 🚀 Project Overview

FloraAI bridges traditional medicinal knowledge with modern artificial intelligence. Users can capture or upload a plant leaf image through a mobile app, which is processed by a deep learning model hosted on the backend. The system predicts the plant species and enriches the results using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide trustworthy medicinal insights.
